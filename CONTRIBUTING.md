# What to contribute?

Write any algorithm or data structure in the programming language of your choice, and open a pull request. 

# What are the rules?

### 1.
Make sure to add the code to the **appropriate directory**. 

```
+-- problem category (or sub-category)
|   +-- programming language
|   |  +-- your code!
```

If you don't find a proper location for your code, feel free to create it!

### 2.
Make sure to that the code you're adding **is of your own creation.**

If you think this goes without saying, then rest assured that this message is not for you; you already abide by this rule.

[The Hacktoberfest message is strong](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality-standards), and we want to be in tune with their values. For that however,
we maintainers have to be strict when dealing with spam, which is plenty, unfortunately. So here's how it goes:

- **Spam PRs or PRs containing blatant copies of snippets from the web will be immediately tagged `invalid` and closed.** We use up our free time to read, review
and engage in every pull request made to this repository, and any time we waste with spam is lost by not properly engaging with developers who actually want 
to contribute to the event in a constructive manner.

- **If you think your PR was wrongfully taken down, post a comment on your PR clarifying the issue, or just send a mail to any of the maintainers (addresses on their respective profiles).** Given the situation described above, it's totally possible that we end up closing your request by mistake, and we apologize
for it. We'll try our best not to though, and if it does happen, be sure that we'll respond to any inquiries as fast as possible.

Again, We're very sorry if any of this was not for your ears. We hope you understand our need to state all this.

If you're reading this, we really do hope you make a contribution here. Happy hacking! :smile:
