Hello, everyone!

Let's contribute to [**Hacktoberfest 2019**](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) while refreshing our *data structures and algorithms* knowledge.

# [Hacktoberfest 2019 issue + Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/pirataspinhal/algorithms/issues/126)

Implement your favorite **data structure/algorithm/crazy magic in the programming language of your choice (the more the better!)** and open a pull request.

It can be **anything!** Graph problems, sorting algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms... maybe something else entirely? Every contribution counts.

As long as it's your own authentic piece of code, it's welcome! :wink:
